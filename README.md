# NumericalMethods

Created to solve problems with regards velocity and acceleration for a project, like interpolation, with given equations:

Section 1:
-Linear - Two equations
-Quadratic - Three equations - a(t^0)+b(t^1)+c(t^2)=v(t)
-Cubic - Four equations - a(t^0)+b(t^1)+c(t^2)+d(t^3)=v(t)
Quadratic and Cubic are solved Using Partial Pivoting

*The Matrix class can be extracted and used for other purposes 

******Not all options are functional yet, its an old project I sort of abandoned but I'mlooking forward to completing it later in the week :)
